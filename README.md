# Install
1. Put the moulitest repository on the same level as your project ("rendu") folders.
2. Your project folder should have the same name as the test folder. ex. libft

Example folder structure:
-------------------------

	projects
	│   libft # project folder
	│   project2
	│   project3
	│
	└───moulitest
	    │   libft # test folder
	    │   project2
	    │   project3

# Usage
- To launch tests, use:

	$ make test

See available commands in the Makefile

Those tests are mainly based on the work done by Maxime Bacoux "mbacoux" / "Nax" and

- Marc Pastor-Abad "mpastor-", intensive segfault testing.
- Sebastien Puyet "spuyet", pointless testing.
- François Montaro "fmontaro", close collaboration.
- Sebastien Sayada "ssayada", best debug failures ever.
- Nino Wextret "nwextret", intensive shower testing.
