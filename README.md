# Credit

Those tests are mainly based on the work done by Maxime Bacoux "mbacoux" / "Nax" and

- Marc Pastor-Abad "mpastor-", intensive segfault testing.
- Sebastien Puyet "spuyet", pointless testing.
- François Montaro "fmontaro", close collaboration.
- Sebastien Sayada "ssayada", best debug failures ever.
- Nino Wextret "nwextret", intensive shower testing.
